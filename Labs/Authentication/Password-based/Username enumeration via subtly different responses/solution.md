### The Burp suite community edition takes too long to run, so I wrote some Javascript code to get the work done.

- For usernames, just extract the error message and notice the different in one of these messages.
- For passwords, just try to login with the correct username and all passwords and choose the response with no error message.

- I wrote some Javascript programs to get the work done. See instructions below on how to use them.

1. To get the correct username:
- Open the **/login page** of the lab 
- Open the file **attackUsername.js** 
- Open Chrome Dev Tools -> Console. 
- Copy the code of **attackUsername.js** and paste it into the Console, then hit Enter.
- Wait some time for the code to print out the correct username for you.

2. To get the correct password:
- Open the **/login page** of the lab 
- Open the file **attackPassword.js**. 
- Change the **correctUsername variable** to the correct username that you obtain previously.
- Open Chrome Dev Tools -> Console. 
- Copy the code of **attackPassword.js** and paste it into the Console, then hit Enter.
- Wait some time for the code to print out the correct password for you.

3. Log in with the correct username and password.
