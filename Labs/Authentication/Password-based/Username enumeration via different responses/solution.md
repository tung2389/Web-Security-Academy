### The Burp suite community edition takes too long to run, so I wrote some Javascript code to get the work done.

1. To get the correct username:
- Open the file **attackUsername.js** and change the **url variable** to your url for the lab.
- Open Chrome Dev Tools -> Console. 
- Copy the code of **attackUsername.js** and paste it into the Console, then hit Enter.
- Wait some time for the code to print out the correct username for you.

2. To get the correct password:
- Open the file **attackPassword.js**. 
- Change the **url variable** to your url for the lab and the **correctUsername variable** to the correct username that you obtain previously.
- Open Chrome Dev Tools -> Console. 
- Copy the code of **attackPassword.js** and paste it into the Console, then hit Enter.
- Wait some time for the code to print out the correct password for you.

3. Log in with the correct username and password.
